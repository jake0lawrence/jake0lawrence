👋 Hi, I’m Jake Lawrence
🌍 A globally curious tech enthusiast and implementation consultant with a passion for building tools that solve real-world problems.

💻 Professional Background:
For over 4 years, I’ve been a software consultant at Tyler Technologies, helping municipal courts migrate from legacy systems to modern enterprise solutions. My role as an Implementation Consultant spans data discovery, migration, workflow design, automation, and training. With over 50 go-lives under my belt, I empower courts to transition seamlessly into the future.

📚 Current Projects:

1. Ukraine Impact: A neutral analysis platform featuring an Obsidian-style visual graph, automatically aggregating and connecting articles on Ukraine from RSS feeds. Users can comment, upvote, and explore relationships between articles in a continuously growing, data-driven resource.

2. T&C Decoder Tool: Simplifying the complex world of terms and conditions.

3. Nameparse.me: A web app that dynamically parses large name datasets into structured components, designed to handle even the trickiest formats.

🌏 I’m travelling the world—Japan, Ecuador, France, Italy, Poland, and Ukraine (April 2024)—and look forward to being lifelong global traveller.

🇺🇦 I am deeply committed to supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty.

✨ Fueled by the boundless curiosity and creativity of ADHD, I thrive on turning ambitious ideas into detailed, actionable projects.
